    <h1>The scale of animal suffering</h1>
    <div class="article-body">
        <p>I believe that factory farming is one of the greatest modern moral catastrophes. There are trillions of farmed animals, the vast majority of which live in factory farms where we have evidence that they experience extreme pain and suffering. Humans are prone to scope insensitivity, which means weâ€™re unable to internalise the scale of how many farmed animals there are, and as a result, how vast their collective suffering is.</p>
        <p>What makes this particularly uncomfortable is that it reveals our capacity for systemic moral blindness. Over time, humanity's moral circle has expanded; and while expanding it to non-human animals follows this trajectory, so far, humanity has largely resisted taking action.</p>
        <p>Animal suffering is often neglected because they're considered less intelligent - ignoring that capacity for welfare doesn't necessarily correlate with intelligence; for example, it is commonly understood that babies can suffer intensely despite limited cognitive abilities.</p>
        <p>Just as we've created an industrial system that inflicts massive suffering while most look away, we risk creating AI systems that could perpetuate moral catastrophes at unprecedented scales. The gradual disempowerment scenario shows how we might slowly sleepwalk into irreversible harm through incremental, rational choices. Our failure to address factory farming, despite overwhelming evidence, demonstrates the need to confront our moral blindness. If we can't stop harming billions of beings we know can suffer, how can we ensure we make ethical choices about AI systems that might affect all sentient life?</p>
